# Batch processing with Akka #

This is a learning exercise to improve my Akka skills.  It's based on an example from http://letitcrash.com/post/29044669086/balancing-workload-across-nodes-with-akka-2

It's a purely message-driven architecture, with an asynchronous work feed.

Don't even think about using this in production. 

There is some Spring integration, but it's there as an example.
